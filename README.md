Animal Encyclopedia

Hello to whoever is reading this.

My name is Kshitij Yadav and this was my first year, second sem project given to us by Miss Saraswathi V(Value Added Course subject teacher). I, being fond of dinosaurs came up with this idea of making a website which displays the information of particular animals. We were planning to make the website fetch data on its own from a different source and display it on our site but that never worked out for us. So at the end we created a few pages and asked a few of my team mates to find some information on mammals for the same. Below is the contribution of our team.

Hrushikesh P : Main page and search functionality using javascript. Co-team leader.
Kshitij Y    : Ideation and design of display template for the animal page using HTML and CSS. Co-team leader.
Rishav K     : Fetched the animations.
Shivam S     : Gathering of data on animals.
Akash R S    : Created about us page.
