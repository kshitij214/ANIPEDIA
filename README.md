# ANIPEDIA
Animal Encyclopedia

Hello to whoever is reading this.

My name is Hrushikesh Patel and this was my first year, first sem project given to us by saraswathi V(Value Added Course subject teacher). One of my friend, fond of dinosaurs gave this idea
of making an website which display the information of particular animals. We were planning to make the website fetch data on its own from a different and display it on our 
site but that never worked out for us. So at the end we created a few pages and asked a few of my team mates to find some animations. Below is the contribution of our team.

Hrushikesh P : Main page and search functionality using javascript.
Kshitij Y    : Ideation and design of display template for the animal page.
Rishav K     : Bringer of the animations.
Shivam S     : Collector of data of animals.
Akash R S    : Disturbance in the group.
